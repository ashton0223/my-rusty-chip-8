# my-rusty-chip-8
A CHIP-8 interpreter written in rust.

## Usage
1. Make sure you have SDL2 installed on your system
2. Run `cargo build --release` in the main program directory (NOT `src`)
3. Navigate to `target/release`
4. Run `my-rusty-chip-8 /path/to/rom`

The left side of the keyboard (1-4, q-r, a-f, and z-v) functions as the hex pad for controls.
